\section{Background: Lightweight Resource Leak Checking}
\label{sec:rlc}

\todo{Write a background section about the parts of the RLC that are relevant.
  The way that we should do this is that we should draft the rest of the paper first,
  assuming that readers are familiar with the RLC. Then, we should write this section
  so that it gives readers exactly the background that they need to understand the rest.}
