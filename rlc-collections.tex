\begin{abstract}
  % A resource leak occurs when a program allocates a resource, such as a
  % socket or file handle, but fails to deallocate it.
  % Resource leaks cause resource starvation, slowdowns, and crashes.
  % 
  % Static detection of resource leaks requires checking that de-allocation methods
  % are always invoked on relevant objects before they become unreachable.
  % % We observe that detecting a resource leak for an object involves three
  % % parts: 1) tracking its \emph{must-call obligations},
  % % 2) tracking which methods have been called on it, and 3) comparing
  % % these to check if the obligations have been fulfilled.
  % Our key insight is that leak detection can be reduced to an
  % accumulation problem, a class of typestate problems amenable
  % to sound and modular checking without the need for a heavyweight,
  % whole-program alias analysis.
  % % We developed a
  % % baseline leak checker via this approach.
  % % Rashmi said the following was too negative, and I agree:
  % % , but found
  % % that it suffered from an excess of false positives.
  % The precision of an accumulation analysis can be improved by computing
  % targeted aliasing information, and we augmented our baseline checker with
  % three such novel techniques:
  % a lightweight ownership transfer system;
  % a specialized resource alias analysis;
  % and a system
  % to create a fresh obligation when a non-final resource field
  % is updated.
  % % check that re-assignments to non-final fields
  % % that hold a resource are safe.
  % %% MK: the below is too wordy - less jargon in the abstract, just the summary
  % %%
  % %% Lightweight ownership tracking is a
  % %% technique to help determine which alias is responsible for releasing
  % %% a resource.  Since our goal is only to prevent resource leaks, our
  % %% ownership tracking avoids many of the heavyweight aliasing
  % %% restrictions associated with other ownership type systems.
  % %% Resouce alias analysis is a specialized, lightweight must-alias analysis
  % %% that identifies program elements that definitely control the same resource.
  % %% Accumulation frames extend the theory of accumulation analysis to permit
  % %% certain kinds of cycles in the typestate automaton.
  %
  % Our approach occupies a unique slice of the design space: it is sound
  % and runs relatively quickly
  % %\todo{mention ``unsound''?}
  % (taking minutes on programs that a
  % state-of-the-art approach
  % took hours to analyze).
  % We implemented our techniques for Java in an open-source tool
  % called \tool.
  % \Tool revealed 49 real resource leaks in widely-deployed software.
  % It scales well, has a manageable false positive rate
  % (comparable to the high-confidence
  % resource leak analysis built into the Eclipse IDE), and
  % imposes only a small annotation burden (1/1500 LoC) for developers.

\section{Conclusion}

We have developed a new, sound, modular approach for detecting and preventing
resource leaks in large-scale Java programs.  \Tool consists of sound core
analyses, built on the insight that leak checking is an accumulation problem,
augmented by three new features to handle common aliasing patterns: lightweight
ownership transfer, resource aliasing, and obligation creation by
non-constructor methods.

\Tool
discovered 49 resource leaks in heavily-used, heavily-tested Java code.
Its analysis speed is an order of magnitude faster
than whole-program analysis, and its false positive rate is similar to a
state-of-the-practice heuristic bug-finder.
It reads and verifies user-written specifications; the annotation burden
is about 1 annotation per 1,500 lines of code.

%% In future work, we plan to develop
%% improved inference techniques for lightweight ownership annotations.  Since
%% these annotations can be added anywhere without impacting soundness (they
%% are verified, not trusted), genetic
%% search
%% and machine-learning techniques could be used to introduce them, using the
%% warnings emitted by \tool as the fitness function.
