\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

We implemented \Tool on top of the Checker Framework~\cite{PapiACPE2008},
an industrial-strength framework for building pluggable type systems
for Java. The Must Call and Called Methods checkers are implemented
directly as Checker Framework checkers.  The Ownership Checker is
implemented as a post-analysis pass over the control flow graph
produced by the Checker Framework's dataflow analysis, which is invoked
when the other two checkers terminate. The framework provides the
Must Call and Called Methods checkers with flow-sensitive local type
inference, support for Java generics and qualifier polymorphism, and
other conveniences. Our implementation is open-source and available
at \todo{create an anonymous copy of the repo}.
