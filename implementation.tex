\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

We implemented \tool on top of the Checker Framework~\cite{PapiACPE2008},
an industrial-strength framework for building pluggable type systems
for Java. The checkers which propagate and infer \MustCall and
\<@CalledMethods> annotations are implemented
directly as Checker Framework type-checkers.  The Must Call Consistency
Checker (\cref{alg:consistency-checker}) is
implemented as a post-analysis pass over the control-flow graph
produced by the Checker Framework's dataflow analysis, and is invoked
when the other two checkers terminate. The framework provides the
checkers with flow-sensitive local type
inference, support for Java generics and qualifier polymorphism, and
other conveniences. Our implementation is open-source and
distributed as part of the Checker Framework (\url{https://checkerframework.org/})
from version 3.15.0.
