\begin{abstract}
  Resource leaks remain a significant software quality issue and a key cause of problems like slowdowns and crashes.  Many techniques have been developed to prevent resource leaks, but existing techniques have a variety of drawbacks.  Language constructs can prevent certain classes of leaks, but they often have restricted applicability.  Other techniques frame resource leak detection as a typestate problem, and apply techniques from typestate verification to perform detection.  Typestate-based techniques require sophisticated reasoning about pointer aliasing, and hence suffer from either scalability issues or a high annotation burden for developers.  We desire a method for preventing resource leaks that is both lightweight, with a minimal annotation burden, and modular, to enable scalability.

  We observe that resource leak detection is an instance of an \emph{accumulation problem}, a class of typestate problems amenable to sound checking \emph{with no alias analysis}.  We developed a baseline sound and modular leak checker via this approach, but found that it suffered from an excess of false positives.  To reduce false positives, we introduce \emph{lightweight ownership tracking}, a technique to help determine which alias is responsible for releasing a resource.  Since our goal is only to prevent resource leaks, our ownership tracking avoids many of the heavyweight aliasing restrictions associated with other ownership type systems.  We implemented our techniques in a tool XXX for Java, and show that it scales well, finds real bugs with a low false positive rate, and imposes only a low additional annotation burden for developers.
