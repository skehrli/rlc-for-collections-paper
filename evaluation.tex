Our evaluation has three parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item case studies on open-source projects, which show that our approach
  is scalable and finds real bugs (\cref{sec:case-studies}).
\item an evaluation of the contributions of our enhancements:
  lightweight ownership, % (\cref{sec:lightweight-ownership}),
  resource aliasing, % (\cref{sec:must-call-choice}), and
  accumulation frames % (\cref{sec:reset-must-call})
  (\cref{sec:ablation}).
\item a comparison to previous leak detectors:  both heuristic bug-finding
  and heavy-weight whole-program
  % typestate
  analysis (\cref{sec:compare}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Case studies on open-source projects}
\label{sec:case-studies}

We selected \todo{3} popular open-source projects with significant
usage of resources that were analyzed by prior work~\cite{zuo2019grapple}.
For each project, we selected and analyzed one module
containing significant uses of leakable resources. We used
the latest version of the source code that was available
when we analyzed the code.

We modified the
build system to run our analysis on the module. We manually
annotated each program with must-call, called-methods, and ownership
annotations (the ``Annos'' column in \cref{tab:case-studies}).
We also
made small, semantics-preserving changes to the programs---such as adding
\<final> modifiers to fields---to reduce
false positives from our analysis. We report the total number
of new lines we added to each project, excluding changes
that have no impact on run-time behavior, such as annotations, comments,
warning suppressions, or import statements (``LoC changed'').
We ran the analysis and manually categorized each warning as revealing a
real resource leak (a true positive or TP) or as correct code that our
system is unable to prove correct (a false positive or FP\@).
We discarded all warnings concerning uses of classes that are not
part of the JDK.
The
annotated versions of the case study programs (including
the commit hashes that we analyzed) are available at
\todo{an anonymized fork of the projects}.
While performing the case study, most of our time was spent
understanding the code under analysis (which no authors were familiar
with before beginning), writing annotations and especially categorizing
warnings as true or false positives.

We also measured the number of
possible resource leaks in each project (``resources''),
by instrumenting our analysis to record each time that
a new obligation was introduced for an object whose declared type
is part of the JDK.
We measured the run time,
as the median of 5 trials on
% This is Mike's home machine.  Are there any other relevant parameters?
a machine with an Intel Core i7-10700 CPU running at 2.90GHz and 64GiB of RAM\@.


\Cref{tab:case-studies} summarizes the results. \Tool found multiple
serious resource leak bugs in every program. \Tool issues
more false positives than true positives in each program, but
the number is small enough to be examined by a single developer in a
few hours.  This is a small price to pay for knowing that the program is
definitely free of resource leaks.  The annotations in the program are
also a benefit: as a form of machine-checked documentation, they
express the programmer's intent and, unlike traditional comments,
cannot become out-of-date if the checker is passing.

\todo{Do the following!}

\todo{Describe some examples of true and false positives.}
\todo{Definitely discuss our confirmed bug that Narges got fixed.}

\todo{Discuss the annotations that had to be written by hand.}

\end{table}

The base analysis of \cref{sec:base-type-systems} produces significantly
more false positives, because it lacks 
lightweight ownership (\cref{sec:lightweight-ownership}),
resource aliasing (\cref{sec:must-call-choice}), and
accumulation frames (\cref{sec:reset-must-call}).
each contribute to \Tool's precision by eliminating false positives.
To show the contribution of each enhancement, we individually disabled each
feature and re-ran the experiments in \cref{sec:case-studies}.
Since all variants are sound (no false
negatives), any difference in warnings is a false positive that is prevented
by the feature.

\Cref{tab:ablation} shows that each of lightweight
ownership and resource aliases prevents more false positive errors than the total number
of remaining false positives on the Zookeeper benchmark, for example. \todo{Strengthen
  this claim when we have the results from the other benchmarks.} Though
the accumulation frame feature prevents fewer errors, it permits verification
of a complex pattern---the use of non-final, owning fields---that is used in a
few critical places in each benchmark.

\subsection{Comparison to other tools}
\label{sec:compare}

Our approach represents a novel point in the design space of resource leak checkers.

In this section, we compare our approach with two other modern tools that detect resource leaks:
\begin{itemize}
\item The analysis built into the Eclipse Compiler for Java (ecj), which is the default approach
  for detecting resource leaks in the Eclipse IDE~\cite{ecj-resource-leak}.
\item Grapple~\cite{zuo2019grapple}, an unsound, typestate-based analysis that represents a significant, recent
  improvement in the scalability of typestate-based tools that require a whole-program alias analysis.
\end{itemize}
Each tool is evaluated against the four criteria that we proposed in \cref{sec:intro}
for an ideal resource-leak detector: analysis speed, applicability to legacy code, soundness (i.e. ability
to detect all errors), and precision (i.e. lack of false positive warnings).

\subsubsection{Eclipse}
\label{sec:eclipse}

The Eclipse analysis is a simple dataflow analysis
augmented with heuristics. Because it is tightly integrated with
the compiler, it scales well and runs quickly. It contains
heuristics for ownership, resource wrappers, and resource-free
closeables, among others; these are all hard-coded into the analysis and cannot
be adjusted by the user. It does not support annotations to express
specifications that differ from its defaults.
It supports two levels of analysis: detecting high-confidence resource
leaks and detecting ``potential'' resource
leaks (a superset of high-confidence resource leaks).

We ran this analysis on the same version of Zookeeper's zookeeper-server
module that we ran \Tool on in \cref{sec:case-studies}. It is easy to apply
to legacy code and it is fast---nearly instantaneous once Eclipse
has loaded the project.

In ``high-confidence'' mode on zookeeper-server, Eclipse reports 3
warnings: 1 true positive (thus, it misses 9 real resource leaks) and 2
false positives.
In ``potential'' leak mode, the analysis reported 180
warnings:  3 true positives (it misses 7 real resource leaks) and 177 false
positives.
The most common cause of false
positives was the unchangeable, default ownership transfer assumption
at method invocations: each call to a method such as
\<Socket\#getInputStream> that returns a resource-alias resulted in a
warning.

These results demonstrate that the Eclipse bug-finder is unsound in both
modes: it misses at least 7 real warnings that our tool found when detecting
potential leaks. Further, the analysis is imprecise: in potential leak mode,
the vast majority of warnings are false positives. However, this sort
of bug-finding tool does have two advantages: it is fast, and it is easily
applicable to legacy code. Compared to our tool, the Eclipse analysis
is much faster and equally applicable to legacy code, but both less sound
and less precise.

%% Chandra rightly pointed out that this para make us look lazy. Let's just
%% say what we did, not why we did it.
%%
%% Given that these results on zookeeper-server
%% clearly show the strengths and weaknesses of this tool compared to our own,
%% we did not run it on our other case study programs.

\todo{Be very sure that Grapple is unsound - read their paper again, and
   point out why in this paragraph.}
\todo{be sure to note that Grapple is not modular, unlike us}
Grapple~\cite{zuo2019grapple} is a modern typestate-based resource leak analysis
focused on precision and (relative) scalability. Grapple models its alias and
dataflow analyses as dynamic transitive-closure computation of graph
representations of the target programs. Grapple, like all previous
typestate-based analyses, requires a whole-program alias analysis. Grapple
contains four checkers, of which two (IO and Socket) are useful for detecting
resource leaks.

The Grapple authors have already evaluated their tool on earlier
versions\todo{Why don't we repeat our experiments on those earlier
  versions?  This should be easy to do since it's only a few hours of work
  and we are now familiar with the programs.}
 of the case study programs in
\cref{sec:case-studies}~\cite{zuo2019grapple}.
\Cref{tab:grapple} reproduces their claimed results.
Unfortunately, we were
neither able to reproduce their results, nor to run Grapple on current
versions of the programs.  Although the Grapple framework is publicly
available, the analysis is not, and the Grapple authors did not provide it
to us when we requested it.  We also requested Grapple's output, so that we
could compare it to our tool, but the Grapple authors did not provide that
to us either.

Note that the TP and FP numbers not perfectly comparable between a modular
and a whole-program analysis.
Our tool reports violations of a user-supplied specification
(which takes effort to write but provides documentation benefits), so it
can ensure that a library is correct for all possible clients.  By
contrast, Grapple checks a library in the context of one specific client.

Our approach is complementary to Grapple's.
Compared to our approach, Grapple is unsound, 
much more precise,
% equally applicable to legacy code,
and much slower (due to its reliance on
an expensive whole-program alias analysis).
Different users can select whichever tool matches
their priorities.
