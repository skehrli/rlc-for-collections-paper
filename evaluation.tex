Our evaluation has three parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item case studies on open-source projects, which show that our approach
  scales to realistic programs and finds real bugs (\cref{sec:case-studies}).
\item an ablation study that demonstrates the contributions of
  lightweight ownership system (\cref{sec:lightweight-ownership}) and
  accumulation frames (\cref{sec:reset-must-call}) to the false positive
  rate on the case studies in \cref{sec:case-studies} (\cref{sec:ablation}).
\item a comparison study that shows the advantages of our approach against
  two traditional approaches: heuristic bug-finders and heavy-weight
  typestate analysis (\cref{sec:compare}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Case studies on open-source projects}
\label{sec:case-studies}

We selected \todo{3} popular open-source projects with significant
usage of resources (and thus high danger of resource leaks), by
convenience.  We modified the build system of each project to run our
analysis. We manually annotated each program with must-call,
called-methods, and ownership annotations. We also
made small changes to the programs, where possible, to avoid
common false positives of our analysis. We then examined all
remaining warnings, and categorized them as either true
positives---real resource leaks---or false positives---code that our
system was insufficiently precise to prove correct. We submitted bug
reports and patches to the projects describing each true positive.
We also measured the number of possible resource leaks in each project.

\Cref{tab:case-studies} summarizes the results.

\todo{Describe some examples of true and false positives.}

\subsection{Ablating lightweight ownership and accumulation frames}
\label{sec:ablation}

Without the lightweight ownership system (\cref{sec:lightweight-ownership}) and
accumulation frames (\cref{sec:reset-must-call}), our analysis produces significantly
more false positives. To show the contribution of each to our tool's precision,
we performed an ablation study on the same programs we used as case studies in
\cref{sec:case-studies} by building four versions of our tool: one with both
features disabled (\emph{NONE}), one with lightweight ownership but without
accumulation frames (\emph{LO-ONLY}), one with accumulation frames but not
lightweight ownership (\emph{AF-ONLY}), and one with both enabled (\emph{FULL}).
We re-ran the experiments in \cref{sec:case-studies} using each variant, and
recorded the change in the number of warnings. Since our analysis has no false
negatives, the difference between the total number of warnings (i.e. the sum of
the ``TPs'' and ``FPs'' columns in \cref{tab:case-studies}) produced by the \emph{FULL}
variant and the total number of false positives produced by each variant is
the number of false positives that are prevented by each feature.

\Cref{tab:ablation} has an entry for each variant on each case study project,
which is the number of extra warnings that that variant reported on the project,
compared to \emph{FULL}.

\subsection{Comparison to other tools}
