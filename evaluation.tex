Our evaluation has three parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item case studies on open-source projects, which show that our approach
  is scalable and finds real bugs (\cref{sec:case-studies}).
\item an evaluation of the contributions of our enhancements:
  lightweight ownership, % (\cref{sec:lightweight-ownership}),
  resource aliasing, % (\cref{sec:must-call-choice}), and
  accumulation frames % (\cref{sec:reset-must-call})
  (\cref{sec:ablation}).
\item a comparison to previous leak detectors:  both heuristic bug-finding
  and heavy-weight whole-program
  % typestate
  analysis (\cref{sec:compare}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Case studies on open-source projects}
\label{sec:case-studies}

We selected 3 popular open-source projects that were analyzed by prior work~\cite{zuo2019grapple}.
For each project, we selected and analyzed one module
containing significant uses of leakable resources. We used
the latest version of the source code that was available
when we analyzed the code.

Our methodology was:
(1)
We modified the
build system to run our analysis on the module, analyzing uses of resource
classes that are defined in the JDK\@.
It also reports the maximum possible number of resources that could be
leaked:  each obligation at a formal parameter or method call.
(2) We manually
annotated each program with must-call, called-methods, and ownership
annotations (see \cref{sec:annos}).
The
annotated versions of the case study programs (including
the commit hashes that we analyzed) are available at
\todo{an anonymized fork of the projects}.

(3) We iteratively ran the analysis to correct our annotations.
We measured the run time

% This is Mike's home machine.  Are there any other relevant parameters?
a machine with an Intel Core i7-10700 CPU running at 2.90GHz and 64GiB of RAM\@.
(4) We manually categorized each warning as revealing a
real resource leak (a true positive or TP) or as correct code that our
system is unable to prove correct (a false positive or FP\@).

\Cref{tab:case-studies} summarizes the results. \Tool found multiple
serious resource leak bugs in every program. \Tool issues
more false positives than true positives in each program, but
the number is small enough to be examined by a single developer in a
few hours.  This is a small price to pay for knowing that the program is
free of resource leaks.  The annotations in the program are
also a benefit: as a form of machine-checked documentation, they
express the programmer's intent and, unlike traditional comments,
cannot become out-of-date if the checker is passing.

\subsubsection{True and false positive examples}
\label{sec:examples}

This section describes some examples of warnings reported by \Tool
in our case studies.\looseness=-1

\begin{figure}
  \lstinputlisting{hadoop-bug.txt}
  \caption{A true positive that \Tool found in Hadoop. Our pull request
    to fix this bug was accepted by Hadoop's developers.}
  \label{fig:hadoop-bug}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:hadoop-bug} contains code from Hadoop. If an IO error
occurs any time between the allocation of the \<FileInputStream>
in the first line of the method and the \<return> statement
at the end---for example, if \<wrapInputStreamForCompression>
throws an \<IOException>, as it is specified to do---then the
only reference to the stream is lost. Hadoop's developers
assigned this bug a priorty of ``Major'' and accepted our
patch.\footnoteanonurl{https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/2652}
One developer suggested using a try-with-resources statement instead
of our patch (which catches the exception and closes the stream),
but we pointed out that
the file needs to remain open if no error occurs so that it can be
returned.  \manu{this example is also interesting in that verifying the caller
is non-trivial.  dunno if we have space, but if we do, we may want to include}
\todo{say something like we are in the process of submitting more bug reports and fixes?}  

\begin{figure}
  \lstinputlisting{zookeeper-optional.txt}
  \caption{Code from the ZooKeeper case study that causes our tool
  to issue a false positive.}
  \label{fig:zookeeper-optional}
\end{figure}

The most common false
positive pattern (with 15 instances) was caused by
a generic container object like \<java.util.Optional> taking ownership of a resource, such
as the example in \cref{fig:zookeeper-optional}. Our lightweight ownership
system does not support transferring ownership to generic parameters,
so \Tool issues an error when \<Optional.of> is returned. In this case, the use
of the \<Optional> class complicates the code; if \<Optional> was replaced
by \<null>,
%% Leave out of submitted version.
% as some advocate~\cite{ErnstNothingIsBetterThanOptional},
\Tool could verify this code. We leave expanding the lightweight ownership system to
support Java generics as future work.

Most false positives were caused by unique coding patterns.
One example is a series of catch
statements, each of which set an \<error> boolean to \<true>, followed
by a \<finally> statement that closed the relevant socket if \<error>
was true.  \Tool reports an error because it cannot reason about arbitrarily
complex path conditions.


\subsubsection{Annotations and code changes}
\label{sec:annos}

\begin{table}
  \caption{The number of annotations that we wrote, across all
    three case studies.\todo{Order these by how common they are, once
    we have final counts.}}
  \label{tab:annos}
  % counts @InheritableMustCall as @MustCall, for simplicity of presentation
  \begin{tabularx}{\columnwidth}{@{}Xr@{}}
    Annotation          &      Count     \\
    \hline
    \<@Owning>          &      42+      \\
    \<@NotOwning>       &      13+       \\
    \<@MustCallAlias>   &      16+       \\
    \<@ResetMustCall>   &      21+      \\
    \<@EnsuresCalledMethods> & 25+      \\
    \<@MustCall>        &      23+      \\
    \<@PolyMustCall>    &      4+       \\
  \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

% Because most relevant \MustCall and \<@CalledMethods> annotations
% are inferred intra-procedurally, most annotations that we had to write in
% the case studies pertained to ownership or the side-effects of procedures.
\Cref{tab:annos} shows how many of each annotation we wrote, across all three
case studies.  \todo{make the case that this is a low annotation burden?}

  \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\todo{Double-check all numbers.}
We also
made 6 small, semantics-preserving changes to the programs to reduce
false positives from our analysis.
%
In 3 places, we added \<final> to a field; this allows our checker to verify it without using
accumulation frames, which have stricter requirements.
%
In 2 places, we re-ordered a \<try>
statement and a null-check; this makes reasoning more precise by removing an
infeasible control-flow-graph edge.
%
In 1 place, we extracted multiple calls to a method
into a single call that is assigned to a local variable; this allows
flow-sensitive reasoning about the local
variable.

The base analysis of \cref{sec:base-type-systems} produces significantly
more false positives, because it lacks 
lightweight ownership (\cref{sec:lightweight-ownership}),
resource aliasing (\cref{sec:must-call-choice}), and
accumulation frames (\cref{sec:reset-must-call}).
each contribute to \Tool's precision by eliminating false positives.
To show the contribution of each enhancement, we individually disabled each
feature and re-ran the experiments in \cref{sec:case-studies}.
Since all variants are sound (no false
negatives), any difference in warnings is a false positive that is prevented
by the feature.

\Cref{tab:ablation} shows that each of lightweight
ownership and resource aliases prevents more false positive errors than the total number
of remaining false positives on the Zookeeper and HBase benchmarks, for example. \todo{Strengthen
  this claim when we have the results from the other benchmarks.} Though
the accumulation frame feature prevents fewer errors (and even adds two more errors
on HBase, which includes only two \ResetMustCall annotations), it permits verification
of a complex pattern---the use of non-final, owning fields---that is used in a
few critical places in each benchmark.

\subsection{Comparison to other tools}
\label{sec:compare}

Our approach represents a novel point in the design space of resource leak checkers.

In this section, we compare our approach with two other modern tools that detect resource leaks:
\begin{itemize}
\item The analysis built into the Eclipse Compiler for Java (ecj), which is the default approach
  for detecting resource leaks in the Eclipse IDE~\cite{ecj-resource-leak}.
\item Grapple~\cite{zuo2019grapple}, an unsound, typestate-based analysis that represents a significant, recent
  improvement in the scalability of typestate-based tools that require a whole-program alias analysis.
\end{itemize}
Each tool is evaluated against the four criteria that we proposed in \cref{sec:intro}
for an ideal resource-leak detector: analysis speed, applicability to legacy code, soundness (i.e. ability
to detect all errors), and precision (i.e. lack of false positive warnings).

\subsubsection{Eclipse}
\label{sec:eclipse}

The Eclipse analysis is a simple dataflow analysis
augmented with heuristics. Because it is tightly integrated with
the compiler, it scales well and runs quickly. It contains
heuristics for ownership, resource wrappers, and resource-free
closeables, among others; these are all hard-coded into the analysis and cannot
be adjusted by the user. It does not support annotations to express
specifications that differ from its defaults.
It supports two levels of analysis: detecting high-confidence resource
leaks and detecting ``potential'' resource
leaks (a superset of high-confidence resource leaks).

We ran this analysis on the same version of Zookeeper's zookeeper-server
module that we ran \Tool on in \cref{sec:case-studies}. It is easy to apply
to legacy code and it is fast---nearly instantaneous once Eclipse
has loaded the project.

In ``high-confidence'' mode on zookeeper-server, Eclipse reports 3
warnings: 1 true positive (thus, it misses 9 real resource leaks) and 2
false positives.
In ``potential'' leak mode, the analysis reported 180
warnings:  3 true positives (it misses 7 real resource leaks) and 177 false
positives.
The most common cause of false
positives was the unchangeable, default ownership transfer assumption
at method invocations: each call to a method such as
\<Socket\#getInputStream> that returns a resource-alias resulted in a
warning.

These results demonstrate that the Eclipse bug-finder is unsound in both
modes: it misses at least 7 real warnings that our tool found when detecting
potential leaks. Further, the analysis is imprecise: in potential leak mode,
the vast majority of warnings are false positives. However, this sort
of bug-finding tool does have two advantages: it is fast, and it is easily
applicable to legacy code. Compared to our tool, the Eclipse analysis
is much faster and equally applicable to legacy code, but both less sound
and less precise.

%% Chandra rightly pointed out that this para make us look lazy. Let's just
%% say what we did, not why we did it.
%%
%% Given that these results on zookeeper-server
%% clearly show the strengths and weaknesses of this tool compared to our own,
%% we did not run it on our other case study programs.

\todo{Be very sure that Grapple is unsound - read their paper again, and
   point out why in this paragraph.}
\todo{be sure to note that Grapple is not modular, unlike us}
Grapple~\cite{zuo2019grapple} is a modern typestate-based resource leak analysis
focused on precision and (relative) scalability. Grapple models its alias and
dataflow analyses as dynamic transitive-closure computation of graph
representations of the target programs. Grapple, like all previous
typestate-based analyses, requires a whole-program alias analysis. Grapple
contains four checkers, of which two (IO and Socket) are useful for detecting
resource leaks.

The Grapple authors have already evaluated their tool on earlier
versions\todo{Why don't we repeat our experiments on those earlier
  versions?  This should be easy to do since it's only a few hours of work
  and we are now familiar with the programs.}
 of the case study programs in
\cref{sec:case-studies}~\cite{zuo2019grapple}.
\Cref{tab:grapple} reproduces their claimed results.
Unfortunately, we were
neither able to reproduce their results, nor to run Grapple on current
versions of the programs.  Although the Grapple framework is publicly
available, the analysis is not, and the Grapple authors did not provide it
to us when we requested it.  We also requested Grapple's output, so that we
could compare it to our tool, but the Grapple authors did not provide that
to us either. \manu{I think this is strictly-speaking true but a bit harsh.  We
may want to tone it down a bit.}

Note that the TP and FP numbers not perfectly comparable between a modular
and a whole-program analysis.
Our tool reports violations of a user-supplied specification
(which takes effort to write but provides documentation benefits), so it
can ensure that a library is correct for all possible clients.  By
contrast, Grapple checks a library in the context of one specific client.

Our approach is complementary to Grapple's.
Compared to our approach, Grapple is unsound, 
much more precise,
% equally applicable to legacy code,
and much slower (due to its reliance on
an expensive whole-program alias analysis).
Different users can select whichever tool matches
their priorities.
