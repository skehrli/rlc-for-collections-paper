\begin{abstract}
  A resource leak occurs when a program allocates a resource, such as a
  socket or file handle, but fails to deallocate
  it.  Resource leaks are an important, common problem that cause resource
  starvation, slowdowns, and crashes.  Previous techniques
  to prevent resource leaks are unsound,
  imprecise, inapplicable to existing code, slow, or a combination
  of these.\looseness=-1
  
  We observe that detecting a resource leak for a variable involves three
  parts: 1) tracking its \emph{must-call obligations},
  2) tracking which methods have been called on it, and 3) comparing
  the results of these to check if its obligations have been fulfilled.
  Our key insight is that these can be reduced to an
  accumulation problem, a class of typestate problems amenable
  to sound and modular checking without the need for a heavyweight,
  whole-program alias analysis.  We developed a
  baseline leak checker via this approach.
  % Rashmi said the following was too negative, and I agree:
  % , but found
  % that it suffered from an excess of false positives.
  The precision of an accumulation analysis can be improved by computing
  targeted aliasing information, and we devised three novel techniques
  that use this capability to achieve precision in practice:
  a lightweight ownership transfer system;
  a specialized resource alias analysis;
  and a system
  to soundly reset analysis state when a non-final resource field
  is updated.
  % check that re-assignments to non-final fields
  % that hold a resource are safe.
  %% MK: the below is too wordy - less jargon in the abstract, just the summary
  %%
  %% Lightweight ownership tracking is a
  %% technique to help determine which alias is responsible for releasing
  %% a resource.  Since our goal is only to prevent resource leaks, our
  %% ownership tracking avoids many of the heavyweight aliasing
  %% restrictions associated with other ownership type systems.
  %% Resouce alias analysis is a specialized, lightweight must-alias analysis
  %% that identifies program elements that definitely control the same resource.
  %% Accumulation frames extend the theory of accumulation analysis to permit
  %% certain kinds of cycles in the typestate automaton.

  Our approach occupies a unique slice of the design space when compared
  to prior approaches: it is sound
  and runs quickly compared to heavier-weight\todo{mention ``unsound''?} approaches.
  We implemented our techniques for Java in an open-source tool
  called \Tool.
  \Tool revealed real bugs in widely-deployed software.
  \todo{In the following sentence, try to replace subjective words with
    objective measures.}
  It scales well, has a low false positive rate, and
  imposes only a low additional annotation burden for developers.
