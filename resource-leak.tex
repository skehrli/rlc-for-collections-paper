\begin{abstract}
  A resource leak occurs when a program allocates a resource, such as a
  socket or file handle, but fails to deallocate
  it.  Resource leaks
  % are an important, common problem that
  cause resource
  starvation, slowdowns, and crashes.  Previous techniques
  to prevent resource leaks are either unsound,
  imprecise, inapplicable to existing code, slow, or a combination
  of these.
  
  Static detection of resource leaks requires checking that de-allocation methods
  are always invoked on relevant objects before they become unreachable.
  % We observe that detecting a resource leak for an object involves three
  % parts: 1) tracking its \emph{must-call obligations},
  % 2) tracking which methods have been called on it, and 3) comparing
  % these to check if the obligations have been fulfilled.
  Our key insight is that leak detection can be reduced to an
  accumulation problem, a class of typestate problems amenable
  to sound and modular checking without the need for a heavyweight,
  whole-program alias analysis.
  % We developed a
  % baseline leak checker via this approach.
  % Rashmi said the following was too negative, and I agree:
  % , but found
  % that it suffered from an excess of false positives.
  The precision of an accumulation analysis can be improved by computing
  targeted aliasing information, and we augmented our baseline checker with
  three such novel techniques:
  a lightweight ownership transfer system;
  a specialized resource alias analysis;
  and a system
  to create a fresh obligation when a non-final resource field
  is updated.
  % check that re-assignments to non-final fields
  % that hold a resource are safe.
  %% MK: the below is too wordy - less jargon in the abstract, just the summary
  %%
  %% Lightweight ownership tracking is a
  %% technique to help determine which alias is responsible for releasing
  %% a resource.  Since our goal is only to prevent resource leaks, our
  %% ownership tracking avoids many of the heavyweight aliasing
  %% restrictions associated with other ownership type systems.
  %% Resouce alias analysis is a specialized, lightweight must-alias analysis
  %% that identifies program elements that definitely control the same resource.
  %% Accumulation frames extend the theory of accumulation analysis to permit
  %% certain kinds of cycles in the typestate automaton.

  Our approach occupies a unique slice of the design space: it is sound
  and runs relatively quickly
  %\todo{mention ``unsound''?}
  (taking minutes on programs that a
  state-of-the-art approach
  took hours to analyze).
  We implemented our techniques for Java in an open-source tool
  called \tool.
  \Tool revealed 49 real resource leaks in widely-deployed software.
  It scales well, has a manageable false positive rate
  (comparable to the high-confidence
  resource leak analysis built into the Eclipse IDE), and
  imposes only a small annotation burden (1/1500 LoC) for developers.

\section{Conclusion}

We have developed a new, sound, modular approach for detecting and preventing
resource leaks in large-scale Java programs.  \Tool consists of sound core
analyses, built on the insight that leak checking is an accumulation problem,
augmented by three new features to handle common aliasing patterns: lightweight
ownership transfer, resource aliasing, and obligation creation by
non-constructor methods.

\Tool
discovered 49 resource leaks in heavily-used, heavily-tested Java code.
Its analysis speed is an order of magnitude faster
than whole-program analysis, and its false positive rate is similar to a
state-of-the-practice heuristic bug-finder.
It reads and verifies user-written specifications; the annotation burden
is about 1 annotation per 1,500 lines of code.

%% In future work, we plan to develop
%% improved inference techniques for lightweight ownership annotations.  Since
%% these annotations can be added anywhere without impacting soundness (they
%% are verified, not trusted), genetic
%% search
%% and machine-learning techniques could be used to introduce them, using the
%% warnings emitted by \tool as the fitness function.
