\begin{abstract}
  Resource leaks remain a significant software quality issue and a key
  cause of problems like slowdowns and crashes.  Many techniques have
  been developed to prevent resource leaks, but existing techniques
  have a variety of drawbacks.  Language constructs can prevent
  certain classes of leaks, but they often have restricted
  applicability.  Other techniques frame resource leak detection as a
  typestate problem, and apply techniques from typestate verification
  to perform detection.  Typestate-based techniques require
  sophisticated reasoning about pointer aliasing, and hence suffer
  from either scalability issues or a high annotation burden for
  developers.  We desire a method for preventing resource leaks that
  is both lightweight, with a minimal annotation burden, and modular,
  to enable scalability.

  We observe that resource leak detection is an instance of an
  \emph{accumulation problem}, a class of typestate problems amenable
  to sound checking \emph{with no alias analysis}.  We developed a
  baseline sound and modular leak checker via this approach, but found
  that it suffered from an excess of false positives.  To reduce false
  positives, we introduce \emph{lightweight ownership tracking}, a
  technique to help determine which alias is responsible for releasing
  a resource.  Since our goal is only to prevent resource leaks, our
  ownership tracking avoids many of the heavyweight aliasing
  restrictions associated with other ownership type systems.  We
  implemented our techniques in a tool XXX for Java, and show that it
  scales well, finds real bugs with a low false positive rate, and
  imposes only a low additional annotation burden for developers.
