\section{Accumulation type systems for resource leak detection}
\label{sec:base-type-systems}

\subsection{A type system for must-call obligations}
\label{sec:must-call}

\subsection{A type system for called methods}
\label{sec:called-methods}

We re-used the accumulation type system for called methods from
prior work~\cite{kellogg20verifying}. \todo{Describe it!}

\subsection{A worklist algorithm for comparing the results of these two type systems}
\label{sec:must-call-invoked}

\todo{The section title needs work...}
