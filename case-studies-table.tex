  \caption{
    Verifying the absence of resource leaks.
    % LoC is computed using scc. Be careful when computing LoC to run scc from relevant top-level
    % directory that only contains source code (not test code!) to make sure that the count is accurate.
    % for Zookeeper, this directory is zookeeper/zookeeper-server/src/main/java
    Throughout, ``LoC'' is lines of non-comment, non-blank Java code.
    ``Resources'' is the number of resources created by the program.
    ``Resource leaks'' are true positive warnings.
    ``False positives'' are where the tool reported a potential leak,
    but manual analysis revealed that no leak is possible.
    % to compute the diff size, do something like the following (this is what I did for Zookeeper) from the with-annotations branch:
    % > git diff origin/with-checker -- '*.java'
    % then count the number of individual changesets and report that
    ``Annotations'' and ``code changes'' are the number of edits to program text; see
    \cref{sec:annotations-and-code-changes} for details.
